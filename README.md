# Appointment-Booking-Test-Automation

The Appointment Booking Test Automation project is designed to test the functionality of an online appointment booking system using Selenium for web automation, SQLite for database operations, and Excel for managing test cases. The project automates the process of filling out and submitting appointment forms, validates the results against expected outcomes, and records valid appointments in a SQLite database.

#Prerequisites

Python 3.x,
Selenium WebDriver,
openpyxl library for reading Excel files,
sqlite3 for SQLite database operations,
ChromeDriver compatible with your version of Chrome
